          <h3>Preamble</h3>
          <p>We purchased the house as-is from the bank in foreclosure. However, my bank wanted some repairs done to
            back the mortgage.</p>
          <p>The repairs were fairly minimal overall, except 3 steel beams that had to be added to the basement wall,
            which we hired out.</p>
          <p>We didn&apos;t have to paint, but this room is going to need to be liveable for awhile, so painting it
            ended up being a feature comfort.</p>
          <p>The list also included adding trim around 4 windows and the back door (inside trim)</p>
          <p>Adding 3 pieces (half-pieces or smaller) of drywall to walls with exposed studs</p>
          <p>Front-door didn&apos;t open easily</p>
          <p>The (then main) bathroom floor was missing pieces of linoleum</p>
          <p>The back of the house had a section of missing siding</p>

          <p>If making this house pretty for the bank was a game, this was round 1 (appraised at 62k) and a refinance in
            2017 (appraised at 110k) would have us make some interesting decisions to pass inspection again. By
            refinance #2 in 2020 (appraised at 185k), I just unlocked every door and played games on my computer, the
            games with the bank were finally over.</p>

          <p>The cabinets in the kitchen were gross. Some had mold, most had deep grease stains that we tried to clean,
            but they were bad.</p>
          <p>Of course, we to change up the layout, swapping the stove and sink to different sides, moving fridge to
            other side and removing the old basement stair way door.</p>
          <p>The wall between the living room and kitchen I felt would look better has a half-wall with a bar. It opens
            the kitchen up to more light and definitely makes it feel bigger.</p>
          <p>Once we tore up the original floor they had these staples that were incredibly difficult to remove, so we
            used rugs over winter so we didn&apos;t step on the ones we missed. In the end, we pounded the rest of them
            flat
            into the floor and put linoleum over it. The pictures are missing the old sink area which had to be
            completely replaced due to water damage.</p>

          <h3>Upstairs Gameroom</h3>
          <p>Previously this room contained the stair-way coming upstairs, a full bathroom and a kitchen! A lot going on
            in such a tiny space, but it was an apartment upstairs at one point. We moved the bathroom to the middle
            room upstairs along with the stair way, so it left this room ready to be a bedroom with a proper
            doorway.</p>

          <p>We removed all of the plumbing (old cast iron pipes) including the cast iron tub. Along with the walls
            around the bathroom. The sink and counter became our temporary sink/counter for the kitchen on the main
            level and served well for a couple of years.</p>

          <p>We put new plywood over the old stairway and hired someone to finish the drywall for us. It was done at the
            same time as the new stairway going upstairs and the half-bath on the main level.</p>
          <p>The flooring was the cheapest wood flooring we could find between Lowes and Menards at $.59/sq ft. It will
            likely get replaced some day, but for a room we rarely use it is holding up just fine for us.</p>

          <p>The future main bedroom was a workshop (circa 2014-2016) and had all the tools and supplies organized in
            it.</p>
          <img src={Master1} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <p>I wired an outlet on the outside and we put up some holiday decor (Christmas 2014)</p>

          <img src={Christmas2} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <p>The gas never got turned on because there was a leak (which I found out later and fixed). But due to some
            technical issues, I needed to make quick work with something to heat the house over winter. This worked very
            well. Can&apos;t say I know too many people that heat their house with Diesel fuel. See &apos;HVAC&apos; for
            an update.</p>
          <img src={Winter1} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <p>The bathroom floor was temporary sticky tiles we got at Lowes for $.49, but I stumbled into some nice
            mosaic tiles thanks to my neighbor so we used it to give our bathroom floor a make over. This was our first
            time doing tile and it turned out quite well. We used ditra underlayment and it was easy to install. With
            some patience we got the tile cut and glued down. We bought the grout/sealer in one and it went down without
            any issues. Overall, pretty easy and I&apos;d do it again to another room. (see Spring 2019)</p>

            line
            snaked in the fall, but it still wasn&apos;t great over winter. In the spring we had to replace 25 foot of
            line
            from the main back toward the house. Luckily I knew a guy who knew a guy and we got it done cheap. We dug
            down about 9 feet right to the brick main line. We added 2 clean outs, just below the surface so we could
            snake easier should the tree roots pose a problem down the road.</p>

            think make this
            apparent, but the outside couldn&apos;t be neglected any longer. We had to start cleaning it up.</p>
          <p>Before moving in, I found a deal to have some trees trimmed up and a few stumps removed. However this brush
            was still laying around and we didn&apos;t have time to move forward with anything else.</p>
          <p>The lawn was mostly weeds, so getting Scott&apos;s Lawncare out to treat it was a must</p>
          <p>My parents then visited and helped with the &apos;vision&apos; portion as well as clean up</p>
          <p>Dad was not impressed by my solar landscape lights, so better ones were installed</p>

            while also keeping it mowed. We opted to remove the mostly dead tree, old concrete steps. We also opted to
            give the driveway some breathing room for vehicles. Finally a project worthy of the Kubota!</p>

          <p>Up until this point we had relied on a series of electric heaters and the diesel heater for winter. It was
            noisy, smelly and cold since we couldn&apos;t keep the whole house a consistent temperature. We pushed for
            the
            refinance in October and got the funding needed to put in a whole new HVAC system in November 2017. This
            included all new duct work for both stories as well as Furnace, AC and humidifier. It took them 5 days in
            total to complete the work and we&apos;re very happy with the results. Our house had never been this
            comfortable.
            We have a gas bill now as the furnace was the first gas appliance, but even with this, our utility bill is
            so much better than previous winters.</p>

          <h3>Pond</h3>
          <p>At this point we&apos;re doing pretty well in the house and weekends now include less-remodel and more fun
            projects. Well in Summer 2018, we got bored one weekend and decided to dig a pond in the backyard. It
            wasn&apos;t
            completely spontaneous
            as we had been thinking about it, but we started laying out some measurements and decided to go 10&apos; x
            8&apos; by
            2&apos; deep. The liner is just pond-liner from Lowes and put some rocks in there for the fish to hide
            around. We
            currently have goldfish. The waterfall was slightly more complex and took a couple of weekends to get
            working right. We wanted the waterfall to be part of the same water system as the pond, so it could act as
            an agitator. Once the base was built, we sealed the corners and used rocks to help guide the water. This was
            a decent V1 waterfall, however after V2 and V3 failed we currently have no waterfall.</p>
          <p>Our neighbor was moving at the time and gave us the brick for a patio. We used it for a retaining wall to
            build up the side of the pond for a patio area. This gives us a place to sit and watch the fish and birds.
            It can be very relaxing to watch the wildlife, who knew. We also made bird houses.</p>

          <p>Fast forward another summer we needed to redo the patio and the waterfall (V3). Both were not great designs
            and we continue to add and improve as time goes on. The running gag is we do everything at least twice, the
            first is just the practice run to learn what we can.</p>

          <h3>Living Room Floor</h3>
          <p>The living room floor had been neglected for awhile (like many other things) and needed attention. My first
            thought was save it and restore it, but if that didn&apos;t work I could cover it with the snap-together
            flooring
            we&apos;d used elsewhere. My brother had some experience refinishing floors so his wife and him visited to
            help
            us out. We rented a floor belt sander from Menards and went to work. As you can see I may have over-done it
            with the plastic to start, but I wasn&apos;t sure of the dust levels so I went safe and it made clean-up
            very
            easy.</p>
          <p>We did not stain the floors. They had enough color and texture to them I figured whatever color they end up
            will be good enough for me. We just coated using Minwax floor poly 3 times. I couldn&apos;t be happier with
            them,
            they look so good and letting their aged imperfections bleed through gives it character. You can&apos;t buy
            that
            original aged look, not for $200, which all this cost in the end. Not only do we no longer get splinters
            walking across it, our mop had all of its fibers at the end with no splinters!</p>

          <h3>Main Bath</h3>
          <p>The main bathroom was a daunting task. We had big plans for it and it was in a complex space. The design
            changed many times and it was the last room on the main floor to get finished and not for a lack of desire.
            If this was going to work we were going to need to do lots of research.</p>
          <p>Deciding the placement of everything was a key first step. The little room... would this be a toilet only?
            privacy throne? Would we put a shower mold in there sideways? Would that leave enough room to get in and out
            of it? What about a shorter bath/shower combo (5&apos; instead of 6&apos;). Hm, what if we made the entire
            room a
            shower and just custom build it! Oh man that sounded crazy, we&apos;d have to learn how to do a shower floor
            from
            scratch and the walls would all be tile. We&apos;d only done tile in our other bathroom floor so far. This
            sounded like the most ambitious DIY project to date and it was!</p>
          <p>After gutting the entire room including walls, ceiling and floor we found that the outer walls of the
            Little Room were not on the cement and you could see the yard outside. Technically it was a porch to a
            front-door at one point. The door bell was still there! We started by putting plywood on the outside wall to
            make a mold and poured concrete from the inside to bring the foundation floor up to the wall. Once the
            foundation was shored up we took out the &apos;extra&apos; wall previously used to hide the old siding, then
            just
            ripped the siding off which was 2 layers. At this point we had the bare original studded walls and this
            would maximize our space.</p>

          <img src={MainBathRaw8} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <p>The old flooring in the main part of the bathroom was not level so we cut that all down to the rafters in
            the basement. We layed new plywood and found that we were not level and it wasn&apos;t really close enough
            to put
            down leveler compound (so we thought). We just left it, the slant sort of helps you to the toilet a little
            faster, just in case. It&apos;s not as bad as it sounds, but you do notice it, at least we do.</p>
          <p>I&apos;ll let the rest of the pictures play it out after this last story. We had an issue with the grout
            drying
            faster than we expected and had to use a nylon brush on the drill to clean it off, but that worked pretty
            well. We found a shower foam board made for center-drain showers at Menards that gave us the perfect slant
            for our tile. The traditional way is to use mortar mix and plastic angle sticks and seemed way out of league
            and this proved much easier. We used a circular saw to cut the porch open for our drain line which was
            easier than we expected, but extremely dusty and doing this in April 2020 proved difficult to get the masks
            we wanted, but we doubled up on some others. We also built our own vanity as we couldn&apos;t find one we
            liked
            that felt sturdy. The design is nothing special we just googled for a blueprint and followed along, but used
            heavier wood and made solid joints to support the marble top which also turned out better than expected. I
            think we&apos;re getting the hang of this DIY thing!</p>

          <h3>Basement</h3>
          <p>The basement is strictly utility so it had to be near the end. However, we&apos;ve made some neat upgrades
            now.</p>
          <p>For starters, the scary door to the crawl space (new door and light).</p>
          <img src={BasementDoor1} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <img src={BasementDoor2} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <p>Fixing the foundation wall that was split in the center. This wall was &apos;fixed&apos; initially, but
            they used
            wood
            to support the steel beams and the boards split, the new solution was a water barrier, re-plant the steel
            beams and anchor with more steel to the house joists. They also included a sump pump and french drain to
            remove water pressue in the ground.</p>
          <img src={Foundation1} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <img src={SumpPump1} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <img src={SumpPump2} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <p>We added a tankless water heater as the old one was starting to lose steam :) we replaced the elements and
            gave it some additional life, but it was on the chopping block. The tankless is really nice, unlimited hot
            water now and it&apos;s NG instead of electric. The kitchen (furthest run) does have a few seconds of lag
            time
            however since the new one adds about 15&apos; to the hot water source and the kitchen has a low-flow
            faucet.</p>

          <img src={WaterHeater3} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <p>The electrical panel was looking scary as well, with rust and it didn&apos;t shut completely. It also had
            mis-matched breakers and was just aging. Not to mention it was in the stair way. The new one looks SO much
            better.</p>

          <img src={ElectricPanel4} alt={''} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
          <p>Sort of the basement and sort of the whole house, we had cat6 wired to all bedrooms, upstairs nook and the
            living room. Previously we had ethernet wires running along trim boards and across the floor to various
            devices. The wall jacks work great and look so much better!</p>

          <p>We did a radon test and found our average around 7. We had a mitigation system installed to alleviate any
            concerns. It&apos;s always good to keep the rads to a minimum. We noticed that contractors seem to prefer
            this
            side of the house as it has all of the fun! With main-power line, Google fiber, a/c unit, furnace exhaust,
            water heater exhaust, radon exhaust and sump pump discharge (not an exhaustive list).</p>

          <p>Hope you enjoyed seeing the progress. It was fun keeping this journal. The thing we learned is we never
            want to do it again. It&apos;s a young couple&apos;s game and if we ever move it&apos;ll be a finished home,
            however the
            yard is no holds barred.</p>
