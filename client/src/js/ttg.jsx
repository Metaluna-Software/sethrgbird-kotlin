          <h3>Forward</h3>
          <p>My initial idea for this page on my website was to simply post online
            copies of the
            gazettes, however there is something intimate and personal about keeping them special to the neighborhood. I
            am happy to send PDFs to families of the triangle, but what I am doing on this page instead is a dive into
            the story behind the story. I will have articles and clippings from specific editions so you&apos;ll get
            some peek into the content. Hopefully it brings some new content for those in it since the beginning and
            some insight into what it was for others. Hope you enjoy!

          <h3>The Triangle</h3>
          <p>The triangle was a 2.2 mile stretch of 3 roads in Whitley County, IN where together they
            formed a triangle. It was unusual in the fact that most roads (country or city) formed squares. They were
            also all named roads where most roads in the country were numbers, so this made our neighborhood unique and
            gave us a bond. People could often be seen walking, biking or running on the triangle as it made for a
            comfortable, yet productive exercise loop.</p>
          <p>Most of my content involved first writing/drawing it out and then trying to recreate it
            in the computer.
            The following was a map I had made showing where each family lived.</p>

        <div className={'content-section'}>
          <h3>The idea</h3>
          <p>In 7th grade, my English teacher (Mrs. Deam) inspired me to further my non-fiction writing. She didn&apos;t
            directly suggest the newspaper, but I credit her with the seed that turned into this adventure. Of course my
            parents were very supportive as well as they always were with these <i>ideas Seth was coming up with</i> and
            I remember brain-storming ideas for sections with mom in the kitchen while making dinner. It was Jan 1999
            and our rural neighborhood in Indiana was about 1/3 related to me (original family farm from my
            great-grandparents divided up over time). With most neighbors being family or friends of family it is not
            unfair to say we had an incredibly safe neighborhood. The type of place where any 7th grader could go up to
            anyone&apos;s front door and start asking for family history, birthdays and all kinds of stuff as
            you&apos;ll soon see.
          </p>
          <p>My friend Andrew and I started the idea for a joint-venture where we would help each
            other. He was planning
            to focus on a Dogs-only newsletter for
            the web and I would focus on my neighborhood. We even had a company name picked out <i>Design Works</i> with
            business cards! I am not sure if he ever
            got that first issue out or not and after my first issue we parted ways as he was not as motivated as me for
            this project. I had also pulled in 2 other friends to help with content so I was moving right along.</p>

        <div className={'content-section'}>
          <h3>The creator</h3>
          <p>First, a bit about 7th grade Seth Bird. He was a straight A student through middle and
            high school. His
            confidence in his ability to write, research, complete tasks, and handle the management of running a
            newspaper were high. Failure at any of these did not
            even cross his mind. Having been using the family computer for a little over a year and learning every
            program that it came with he was just about as confident as one could be. While computers were new, I had
            been using my Aunt and Uncle&apos;s computer for homework as well as computers at school. It seems odd to
            mention that now and I feel old even writing it, but I had a natural attraction to computers and what they
            could do even on day 1.</p>
          <p>I used Microsoft Publisher which had a template for a 4 page newsletter. This became
            obvious on editions
            with 5+ pages as they were a little jarring in layout. Technically they were just blank pages that I used
            the same color themes on. Yes, each
            newsletter was a different color, how fun! Even the cover sheet shown below was a unique color each month
            (as much as possible). Why were newspapers so boring? Well middle-school Seth wasn&apos;t going to let his
            be boring! Of course the library of clip-art available in Microsoft Office made it all the more colorful and
            fun.</p>
          <img src={FirstPage} alt={'ttg page 1'} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
        </div>
        <div className={'content-section'}>
          <h3>The first issue</h3>
          <p>The idea was to bring the neighborhood even closer together by filling in the gaps for
            new
            families and to just keep everyone updated. If it sounds like I was a nosey neighbor, I don&apos;t
            think that even scratches the surface of it. I <i>needed</i> to know everything that was going on. New house
            being built? I visited the construction workers weekly. Someone outside doing a project, there was Seth to
            see what was happening. It was only a natural next step to publish my findings and send it to everyone else
            in the neighborhood. Thinking back actually, just wandering up to strangers&apos; houses, introducing
            myself, then proceeding to invite myself in and just hang out seems very strange even now, but at the time I
            just did it.</p>
          <p>The first issue was free (of course) and helped set the tone for what was to come. Most
            of the layout and
            sections lived on until the end. Surprisingly or not, I sort of just jumped right into it with content and
            only really introduced myself on page 4. Sometimes the headlines and pictures were confusing together, but
            overall you could read through that and learn something new each month. You can see the National News looks
            like an odd transition as it was on page 5 and I had not yet mastered getting the layout copied, nor
            changing the layout. It might seem odd to publish a section for content with no content like elected
            officials and you&apos;d be right. I was committed to my pre-determined sections even if I did not have all
            of the information for them yet. I would finally get some elected official information in the 3rd
            edition.</p>
          <p>My friend Jordan would later right my sports section as he was way more into sports than I was and he was
            happy to do it.</p>

          <h3>Non-triangleans</h3>
          <p>A person not residing within the triangle. Although in my first issue I said the
            newspaper was for neighbors only I quickly got requests from others. This was primarily family and friends
            of family outside of the triangle. The furthest away customer was Tennessee! These non-triangleans
            didn&apos;t
            get the full experience though, they would often receive reduced content due to the cost of printing.
            However they also paid the most as they had to pay for shipping plus a special non-resident mark-up. I also
            could not quite land on the spelling of this word I made up and sometimes added an <i>i</i> to it.</p>
          <p>You might also catch that I included my mom on the Article By section for the price hike.
            I think I may have thrown her under the bus here for ink costs. My first thought was it got carried over
            from the month before, but I looked at the previous month and contribution was me only. Sorry mom!</p>
          <p>Also, just a follow up that the elected officials section did get completed!</p>

        </div>
        <div className={'content-section'}>
          <h3>Cover stories</h3>
          <p>The newspaper started off like most newspapers, with a cover story which was the biggest
            news item of the
            month on the triangle. Themes were usually determined by a holiday in that month. The story was probably the
            most jarring month to month for readers. It was either something
            generic like it&apos;s hot outside or it snowed outside to something more dramatic like a car exploding or
            fires everywhere. Of course there was also the issue where I figured out how to make 2 columns and
            didn&apos;t provide a story in either.</p>
          <p>This was typically followed by some kind of lesser story at the bottom, although looking back sometimes it
            was the more interesting content. Around the 8th issue I started putting weather on the front page
            and near the end I dropped weather altogether. It was the least liked/used section from my survey of
            readers. A weather section seems like an odd choice for a monthly newsletter because it is. It was only 5
            days and usually a day behind by the time I printed and distributed it. The people in Tennessee got to see
            what it was like last week for us in Indiana though!</p>

        <div className={'content-section'}>
          <h3>The Friendly Neighbor</h3>
          <p>This section focused on a deep dive of a family. I would sometimes call out the month before which family I
            wanted to provide a story for the next issue. Nothing like being called out in front of everyone! It seems
            strange now, but my expectations of the neighbors were as high as my own and they had better live up to
            them! I think once the ball got rolling though people liked contributing. While the medium was amateur the
            outcome had real positive influences on neighbors. In discussions with readers they mentioned this was their
            favorite section.</p>
          <p>In response to the support of this section I added a section called <i>An Update...</i> For this, several
            families would be listed each month and would submit an update on what was going on in their lives. I could
            not get a hold of all families every month and it was a very ambitious section to keep up with, but surveyed
            readers cited this as their new favorite.</p>

          <h3>Ads</h3>
          <p>The Triangle Gazette was not exempt from the commercial influence of ads. However, in keeping with the
            local relevance, they were often of nearby businesses. Even our neighborhood Schwan&apos;s man had his
            business card listed for awhile.</p>
          <p>A neighbor needing a babysitter posted their ad in the gazette, as well as the nearby restaurant
            Crossroads. This image below is not inclusive (no reprint ad fees were received) but provides some idea on
            what you might have seen. Ads were limited to the 4th page above the comics section. This was primarily
            because that&apos;s what the layout template suggested for larger images. The same section was used in some
            issues for a survey to customers.</p>
          <img src={Ads} alt={'ads'} className={'seth-tile-img'}/>
        </div>
        <div className={'content-section'}>
          <h3>Home Cook&apos;in</h3>
          <p>Inside content would include a recipe from a neighbor. I never searched the web, etc it had to be from
            someone local. I think almost every neighbor provided something, but Mrs Parnell provided the most. She was
            a cooking/baking master and would distribute treats to various neighbors at Christmas. This is probably one
            section where I had more than enough content each month and it never printed empty. Maybe a Triangle
            Cookbook is in order from everything I had published and what I still have in my <i>future
              articles</i> file. Yes, I had a filing cabinet where I kept most of the content I received for
            the gazette. Most content was submitted on paper either hand-written or printed out. I don&apos;t recall if
            I ever received content from email, though it was possible as I published my email in every issue. I still
            have that file and you&apos;ve seen some of that (raw) content already. You will see more as you keep
            reading.</p>

        <div className={'content-section'}>
          <h3>The file</h3>
          <p>I have always been an organized person, even when things started to get chaotic. The gazette was no
            different, I had a file cabinet where I kept articles in progress, future and past. As well as spreadsheets
            to track who had contributed to which sections. We can&apos;t have the same mystery person twice! And if
            you&apos;re still not convinced, I have those files 22 years later!</p>
          <p>I wanted to share some pre and post article examples to show how I took notes in interviews and what the
            article looked like afterwards. I learned in late eighth grade that when interviewing for a story you should
            record the audio, who knew! I also wanted to just show some of the behind the scenes stuff I used to
            stay organized.</p>
          <p>First is a copy of the interview notes I took from Jack about gardening and then the article I turned it
            into next to it. Then there are some jokes I had planned and marked off each month. The price list for
            customers, always keeping the financials tidy. The list of families in the Friendly Neighbor section and the
            issue they were featured. Lastly, the always incomplete pet census.</p>

          <h3>Sports and Pets</h3>
          <p>I&apos;ve touched on this a bit already, but I really did not follow sports at all (still don&apos;t). My
            friend Jordan was eager to write about them, mainly basketball, but anything really, so he would send me
            content to publish. This was a win for me as I was able to get original content which I was desperate for at
            times and also my friend was getting published as a sports writer. I only had sports content during the
            school year as that&apos;s when Jordan could hand me his articles. As you can see below, I would simply be a
            transcriber for these articles and he&apos;d get his own page! It would usually be the last page, but it
            wasn&apos;t because of the quality of the content, he needed a full page and that is just where I had room
            in the template for it. Thanks Jordan!</p>
          <p>Of course I can&apos;t give a shout out to Jordan without giving an equally appreciated thanks to Jake for
            writing up articles for our furry triangleans! He would write up something topical and/or timely with the
            seasons and we would usually publish pictures of the pets. The content from Jordan and Jake eventually waned
            and I had to do my own. I even got Mary to contribute a Pets section article! When I had to eventually fill
            in for sports they became a lot more local. They included family running adventures and neighbor sporting
            events.</p>

          <h3>School Happenings</h3>
          <p>School Happenings which was from personal knowledge usually, but also came from information the school sent
            home. Heavily influenced by ISMS (middle school I attended) news, but also some contributions from proud
            parents. Honor roll, Accountant, Doctor, the triangle had great role models to follow!

          <h3>National News</h3>
          <p>National news was anything that occurred outside of the triangle. They typically occurred within our same
            county, but you know, not within the Triangle. To this day I have no idea how I chose some of these
            articles. There was 2 page article about Elián González which was a hot topic of the time, but a little
            heavy for the triangle gazette. I suppose I thought it was important as it was on the news a lot at the
            time. National News was not in every edition, it was one that came and went as content was available and
            unlike other sections was not printed empty (except once), but rather omitted. Some of the best articles
            were self-reported by me from nearby including a likely drunk-driver that occurred about a mile outside of
            the triangle and also a story about the local green house, about 5 miles from the triangle. Then there is a
            story about a fire. A fire that may as well have been on the triangle, but was technically the next property
            over from the corner of Keiser and Washington. I was very strict on my local news sections!</p>

          <h3>Filler content</h3>
          <p>I was a busy kid, school, sports and being a kid (so I told myself), so I had to come up with some content
            that felt useful, but at the same time I could quickly generate. Weather and stocks were probably the least
            useful followed by maybe Elected Officials. I never got feedback from these sections other than Myers saying
            Weather was not needed, Mary will tell you how it is! To be fair, this was pre-smart phone era so people had
            to watch the TV to get the weather, but it was still very accessible.</p>
          <p>The comic section, however, Jokes did survey well and every good paper has a funny section. I had a book
            for tongue twisters so these were easy to fill. The guideline was more or less a saying or statement and I
            remember getting stuck on what to call this. Quote of the Month in hind-sight probably would have made more
            sense because guideline left it too open ended and sometimes they seemed to get off track. The content was
            usually filled in with clip art to build the story. Lots of clip art was used if that is not obvious by now
            and made for an easy way to get graphics when I didn&apos;t have pictures. Sometimes even the comic section
            was coordinated such as fish or dog theme as seen below.</p>

          <h3>Stocks and Weather</h3>
          <p>As mentioned above these were probably the least useful, but I enjoyed making these sections for their own
            reasons. For stocks, I got to learn about the financial world if not just for a little bit. At some point,
            Geist offered to explain more of this for me as he was a financial advisor that worked from home. I was able
            to get some new internet references and learn some new lingo. The stock sections got a bit more complex
            after that meeting. The symbols chosen were just interesting to me such as Microsoft and Yahoo which were
            big names of the time in tech. Of course mom worked at Tj Maxx and Walmart before that and I liked shopping
            at both. Others were added over time.</p>
          <p>The weather was fun because it was always different and I got to select different graphics. This is obvious
            below as they did not seem to ever match month to month. I am not sure if I thought they needed to be more
            detailed or what, but for a section providing little value I sure wanted accurate graphics.</p>
          <p>For this analysis of sorts in Summer 2021, I did a deep analysis of MSFT stock. If you had purchased 1
            share of MSFT when I first published the stock symbol how much would you have now? The stock split twice
            since Mar 1999 and the purchase price would have been $165 for a single share. This means you&apos;d have
            paid $41.25 / share. As of this writing, the share price is $250. While this is a nice little gain of $835,
            the dividends paid in the same time frame would have netted you an additional $83 for a grand total of $918
            profit from a $165 investment over 22 years ago. You would have been much better off dumping MSFT in Sept
            2012 and picking up FB stock at a steal for
            $18 a share which today is $325 per share!</p>
          <p>The stocks section may have been slightly more interesting if the <i>change</i> amount was from the
            previous month so it had some continuity between editions. Seeing if it went up or down from the single day
            before is not the most useful in a monthly newspaper. However adding the 52 week high/low was a good start.

          <h3>Neighborly activities</h3>
          <p>Beyond the gazette, I was trying to make the triangle a better place for everyone. It&apos;s a neighborly
            trait
            I still have to this day. Trash pick up was a way for neighbors to join in on a neighborly activity
            together. I was able to get some trash bags donated by the Highway Dept and distribute them. I also made
            sure they would pick them all up on our trash day, which they did. I promoted the trash pick up day and
            rallied everyone to help out. On the day of, I used our lawn tractor with trailer to collect the trash and
            pick up any larger items we found. It was a good turn-out and we made it all the way around!</p>
          <p>The Mongolian cook-out was another such success. We had families bring side dishes/desserts and we had
            prepared meat Mongolian style on a large pan over a fire (article below). My relentless pursuit to bring
            neighbors together would meet its biggest challenger: eighth grade. </p>

          <h3>The last issue</h3>
          <p>News was happening and editions were starting to get spaced out further and further. I found myself
            over-committed and the gazette was losing priority. Here&apos;s what the timeline looked like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>(9/14/00) Twentieth edition released (eighth-grade school year starts)</li>
            <li>(10/03/00) Twenty first issue released (early) because I was promoting the BBQ</li>
            <li>(11/?/00) The twenty second and third issues were combined and released in November (seems on track, but
              things are slipping behind the scenes). A survey goes out as I try to reel in content sprawl and focus on
              important sections.
            </li>
            <li>(05/?/01) The twenty third issue is released (again?). Whenever a new baby was born that
              was a sure fire way to motivate a new edition. We had several new babies on the triangle during the run
              and they always got front page.
            </li>
            <li>(08/?/01) The twenty fourth issue (the last issue) was released sometime late summer and I published
              birthdays through Nov as I believed to be quarterly at this point, however that next edition would never
              come. Motivation for the gazette had waned. The motivation was always going to drop off at some point and
              the BBQ was really the send-off I just didn&apos;t know it at the time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The year 2001 was full of life changing events, losing my grand-father whom I was very close
            with and lived next door, HANDS, starting high school, and 9/11 changing how we operate as a society
            forever. My closest non-family neighbor had just had their first born and their lives were now fully
            involved with her (rightly so). If only time was infinite and we could do everything we wanted, but as I was
            learning becoming a young adult you have to choose and the gazette would get the file.

          <h3>Postmortem</h3>
          <p>I am most surprised I kept it going for almost thee years of my life, which was essentially through my
            Middle School era. In looking back though, my motivation was very high and the bar for publishing an edition
            was actually quite low. My biggest obstacles for getting some late issues out were technology related
            (crashed computer -twice) as well over-commitment of extra-curriculars interfering. I love writing,
            specifically non-fiction, and the social aspect of meeting with neighbors came naturally.</p>
          <p>The consequences for me of the gazette were large and maybe my path would have been similar without it, but
            I attribute a lot to it.</p>
          <p>It starts, as it always does, by helping a neighbor. Our neighbor Jack had surgery and it was fall/winter
            timeframe and we were helping them split wood as it was their primary heat source. Mary publishes an
            article in her favorite newspaper (my words) thanking my grand-father, father, brother, and myself for the
            help.
          </p>
          <p>Her daughter trying to echo this appreciation nominates me for a Heart of Gold award. In addition to the
            log splitting, mentions the local newspaper and my neighborly aspirations. I win with one other contestant
            and we each get $1000 to donate to a charity of our choosing.</p>
          <p>My 7th grade guidance counselor is aware of all of this. I get sent to a young future leader conference in
            Fort Wayne with a couple of others from my grade. I am also a member of student counsel during this time. At
            the end of 7th grade, she (my guidance counselor) nominates me to be on a non-profit organization called
            H.A.N.D.S. which is a local chapter of a multi-county Community Foundation organization. This allows
            students grade 8 through 12 from the local schools to distribute $15,000 yearly through grants submitted
            by members of the community (usually teachers).</p>
          <p>I fully attribute the gazette for my membership in HANDS and it would not have happened without the
            neighbors around me.</p>
