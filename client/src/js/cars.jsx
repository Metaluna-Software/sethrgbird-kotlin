          <h5>(#24) 2023 Toyota Highlander (Dec 22 - ?) - Hannah</h5>
          <p>I have been eyeing Highlanders for awhile (since maybe 2019) and was impressed with the comfort and
            features. The Tundra was not getting driven much and I wanted something less expensive overall. Since we
            were still in the car shortage era I opened 5 local Toyota dealer websites and started chats to see what
            inventory looked like out there. I did not think a base model (LE) would suffice, but it was well equipped.
            I was most interested in the Hybrid and on the fence with AWD. Overall, very happy with choice
            (LE Fr Hybrid) and not
            spending thousands more for things I really do not need feels good in the end. It only gets driven a couple
            of times a week right now so it fits our lifestyle. We also did it as a lease, which I have not done since
            the first XB, so look out 2025 Highlander!.</p>

          <p>This one is an impulse buy mostly. I was looking for something smaller to commute around in and had
          been looking for a small hatchback. While I do have this weird fascination with the Mirage, I could not find
          one meeting my checklist. A dealer found this at another lot and we went to see it. After sitting in it and
            driving it around, it felt familiar and met everything on my checklist.</p>

          <h5>(#22) 2022 Porsche Cayman S (Mar 22 - ?)</h5>
          <p>Technically Matt&apos;s car, but its our cars now, so it goes on the list. It seems soon since the Supra
          but he was ready to step up. He found a reputable Porsche dealer (the one in KC is not) and ordered the
          exact one he wanted from the website. We waited about 6 months for it to be made and shipped from Germany. It
          survived the trek across the Atlantic (the other cargo ship did not -- see Felicity Ace).</p>
          <p>In April, while Matt was at work and coming back from lunch, the engine started acting up. He had it towed
          to the dealership here in KC. They thought it was the injectors, so we waited 2 weeks while they ordered and
          replaced 2 of those. After that they realized Cylinder 1 was not holding compression and figured out it was
          a de-burring issue with the block. We waited another week for them to decide how they were going to fix it.
          At this point, Matt reached out to customer service at Porsche North America as we were getting the run
          around on a rental and could not get clear answers from the dealership (see above about reputable). He was
          assigned a case manager who quickly got us answers. He got a new engine block overnighted from Germany to
          the service center for us, he agreed to reimburse us for the rental we had already and get us a Macan to
          drive until it was fixed, which was about 1 more week. All in, it was about 5 weeks it was down. The new
            block sounds better and it feels like all of the power is there now.</p>
          <p>Matt is super paranoid about the noises it makes now, but since we have never owned an actual race car
          before it is hard to know for sure what sounds are normal.</p>

          <h5>(#21) 2021 Toyota Tundra (Apr 21 - Dec 22) - Tina</h5>
          <p>While looking at Supras that morning, Legends Toyota mentioned a Tundra that met our criteria had just
            arrived. They took the morning to prep and unpack it. 4 hours after buying the Supra and after test driving
            this Tundra we decided to jump into this as well. We then took the picture below that evening in front of
            the Speedway.

            This Tundra is a Limited model in the color &apos;Cement&apos; with the TRD Off Road package. My criteria
            wasn&apos;t too
            difficult, I wanted over a 6&apos; bed, back seat and 4wd. However, it&apos;s very common to give trucks
            with extended
            cabs a 5.5 foot bed. This one snuck in at the right time and we grabbed it. The Limited amenities are a nice
            touch and it&apos;s a comfortable ride. Feels a lot like my older Tundra in some ways with modern
            updates.</p>

            idea had been brewing since February and Matt had been doing his research on it. It&apos;s a very fun car to
            drive and ride in, very smooth and fast! He pinned 3 dealers in KC against each other to get the best price
            and really wanted the color white. In the end he was able to get the price and color he wanted. Look forward
            to more stories in this thing!</p>

          <h5>(#19) 2004 GMC Envoy XUV (Jan 19 - May 21)</h5>
          <p>This was previously my mom&apos;s, then my brother&apos;s vehicle. At the time of purchase, repairs had
            elapsed on it and he was not able to drive it. I made a trade and fixed his computer for the title. I had it
            shipped to Kansas City from Fort Wayne. He had taken it to a shop previously just to understand what it
            would take to drive again, so I had a starting list to work from. Basically the rear shocks (air) were
            rotted, so I replaced them with springs and put new shock absorbers in. Not sure if the rotor / caliper went
            bad during or after the shocks (since it was sitting very low), but the rear brakes needed new pads/rotors
            and 1 side needed a new caliper. It had been in a couple of accidents and the passenger door didn&apos;t
            open very far, so I found a fender at a u-pull-it and replaced it (was green, but spray painted silver). The
            transmission had less than 30k miles on it and the tires were good, so it had those things going for it. The
            final
            thing is to fix the gas leak, which was the fuel sending unit gasket. I also had to get the power steering
            pump replaced as it was leaking. This was the only repair I paid to have done.</p>
          <p>The best feature of the Envoy XUV is the retractable roof. This feature was offered for 2004, 2005 model
            years and are referenced as the XUV trim level. The tailgate opens as either a door (to the right) or truck
            tailgate (drop-down) depending on which button you use to open it. The back glass rolls down, then the roof
            slides open similar to a garage door. This design is flawed in several ways and often doesn&apos;t work on
            these models, however this one does work and it&apos;s fun to watch. The vehicle has
            a &apos;mid-gate&apos; which allows you to close off the rear cargo area from the rear passenger area. The
            cargo area is completely water proof and designed with drainage so you can power wash / clean it out easily
            like a truck bed.</p>

          <p>Our first driveable convertible (sorry, not sorry Sebring). Getting tired of driving the truck across

            liked. It&apos;s new (54 miles) and a 2017, so it was discounted and hard to say no to (have I ever said
            no?). They only get shipments of these every 6 months (so they say) and had limited, but a variety in stock.
            It shares parts and
            an assembly line with the Mazda Miata and some refer to this is as the &apos;Fiata&apos; although it has a
            Fiat engine. It was fun and we learned a lot about Fiat and enjoyed this car. It did have a hand-full of
            service needs, tire developed a bubble, convertible top came apart a couple of times, emblem on the front
            broke, windshield chip which seems like nit-picking but we only put 14,000 miles on this car so it seemed
            like it was alway something. It was maybe slightly more comfortable than the FRS overall, not as much fun to
            drive, but the convertible was fun in its own right.

          <h5>(#17) 2018 Ford Fusion (Mar 18 - Apr 21) - Hayley</h5>
          <p>Caught our eye in late winter and we were ready for another change-up. This time we opted for the Hybrid.
            It looks like the same color, but this one is black, has a larger screen inside and push-button start. We
            also bought this one new. We definitely loved this one as much as the first one. We put 45k miles on it in a
            little over 3 years. It was comfortable on road trips and an easy commuter car. The backseats
            folding nearly flat was great for running to Menards and not knowing what we&apos;d end up with in the
            cart. This will become more apparent in late summer when we say bye to the Tundra.</p>

          <p>Found this little gem while looking for a car for Matt. We had sort of given up on the Sebring by this
            point, but needed something for him to drive. The Aurora was struggling and the Sebring was losing hope. My
            first Ford and we loved it. It was great on gas and comfortable to drive on road trips. The color is
            actually Deep Blue, but it will only show if the sun hits just right, normally it just looks black.</p>
          <p>We put a ton of miles on this thing and drove it everywhere. Great all round car and I think it surprised
            us both.</p>

          <p>After looking at several trucks, Tina stood out in many ways. First her color of blue was very appealing,
            but she had all the qualities I was looking for in a truck. The bed was over 5&apos; (6.5&apos;), lots of
            room for passengers in the 2nd row. She is a blast to drive and it&apos;s nice having something really
            comfortable to drive again as the FRS gets uncomfortable on long trips and ole Roxanne is great, but is
            aging.</p>
          <p>I put 2000 miles on her the first week I had her with a trip to Wisc, Indiana, back to Wisc, back to
            Indiana then back to Kansas. I knew I had made the right choice.</p>
          <p>No accidents in this girl either (maybe it&apos;s a Toyota thing)</p>

          <p>Bought this out of someone&apos;s yard thinking it could be fixed for Matt to drive. It was a convertible
            and had 52k miles on it. The paint and body was is excellent shape. It &apos;only needed a water
            pump&apos;... Long story short that water pump is quite buried in there. Got it mostly disassembled,
            disconnected the old water pump, but still couldn&apos;t get it out of the car. We determined that we needed
            to remove even more of the motor, but gave up on it after realizing it may never run again and wasn&apos;t
            worth the additional time or money. Sold for cash to someone that just wanted the transmission out of it.
            Good riddance. I never even transferred the title to my name, so I am only counting it because it spent
            3 years in our garage.</p>

          <h5>(#13) 2013 Scion FRS (Apr 13 - May 15) - Veronica</h5>
          <p>Meet Veronica. I have been planning this car since I first drove one in late summer 2012. It was early
            morning, dew still on the grass and I was out garage sale hunting with Stephen. A sign by the road read:
            &quot;Today, Scion FRS Test Drive&quot;. I looked at my friend and no words were spoken, we turned around.
            They had
            already setup, but we were early. They had a PS3 setup with Gran Turismo 5; only 1 car available (I&apos;ll
            let you guess). An FRS on display for looking throughly inside and out, along with other promotional items.
            The course was setup at a Police test course and had cones marking the path, 3 cars waited at the start;
            Sophie nervously watching from the parking lot. A few more people showed up, and then we were all able to 1
            by 1 take a cars around the course. I did two laps, then rode with my friend on one of his laps. It was
            quite exhilarating and despite them forcing us to leave traction / stability control enabled the car slid
            with ease around turns. Good promotion, I was sold.</p>
          <p>With only the Aurora bringing me through the Winter I was worried about her reliability and did not need
            any more excuses. The color was a difficult choice at first, but in the end she had to be orange. The color
            was a perfect on her. Although the automatic was surprisingly responsive and agile in the test
            course, a manual is what I ended up getting. Had an orange automatic been on the lot, my choice may have
            been different. I put over 1k miles on her in the first week if that speaks to the fun nature of driving
            this car. The accessories (Scion&apos;s favored method of upgrade packages) included
            the Scion applique on the back bumper, spoiler and tinted windows.</p>
          <p>Only 1 minor accident, a raccoon I hit commuting to work in Kansas City from Leavenworth. Busted up the
            wheel well real good and took the auto body about a week to fix.</p>
          <p>Matt was helping me build shelves in the garage in Leavenworth for my stuff and we needed a bunch of
            lumber. So I drove the FRS and he drove the Aurora and we fill both with supplies. It was around here I
            started to consider a truck.</p>
          <p>Veronica is a 2013 model year, purchased in the year 2013 on the 13th week of the year and is my 13th
            car.</p>

          <p>The teaser photo wasn&apos;t enough. I had to tour her around Kansas City and show her the sights. The
            Plaza; Cerner; Bond Bridge; Power and Light; Google Fiber.

          <h5>(#12) 1998 Mazda 626 (Apr 12 - Aug 12) - Sophie</h5>
          <p>Meredith was at a good value for trading and I was getting bored with her. I first saw Sophie online and
            the next day went to go test drive her. She was perfect. Comfortable ride, good options and clean. A few
            scratches here and there. It was a good car for driving to work and it&apos;s a Mazda, so what&apos;s more
            fun than that?
            She needed an antenna and she was good to go. The serpentine belt had to be replaced after the first
            month. I drove it 2 days without realizing and then the battery finally died. The steering was a little
            tougher, but at the time it didn&apos;t seem much different.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately after my 2nd monthly payment she was totaled (so glad I had GAP insurance, saved me here for
            sure). Heavy traffic merging northbound from I70 onto US291 and while it was accelerating off of the ramp, I
            looked back to ensure I could merge and when I looked forward again the car in front of me had stopped.
            Needless to say slamming the brakes didn&apos;t pan out. You should see the other guy! Oh wait, they&apos;re
            below, basically un-touched. This was either a sign to stop buying 626&apos;s or to stop buying manuals.
            Time will confirm the latter.</p>

          <h5>(#11) 1996 Oldsmobile Aurora (Mar 12 - ?) - Roxanne</h5>
          <p>Well after months of looking, I had finally found the right one. She was very well kept and had 47k miles
            at time of purchase. My plan was to make her my hobby car and get her running smooth again. A car
            that&apos;s 16 years old with 47k miles tends to be a little stiff, so need to change out some fluids, fix a
            couple of sensors, then get her back on the road again. We&apos;ll see if Meredith hangs around much longer
            after that, looking for any out I can from the Camry.</p>
          <p>The initial project to fix sensors was completed in April 2012 right after I got her. The list is below of
            what we (Stephen and I) completed.</p>

          <h5>(#10) 2006 Toyota Camry LE (Feb 10 - Apr 12) - Meredith</h5>
          <p>Came into college with a new XB, traded for another XB then graduated and left with a Vibe. Getting my
            first job was going to be great, I was going to be rolling in cash lol. Moving to
            Kansas City was sort of expensive though and now student loans were due. I needed a car with a lower
            payment and reliable enough to last. Meredith fit this bill. Bought it with just under 57k miles and being
            beige on
            beige, it was about the most basic car on the lot. My Cerner friends drove Camry&apos;s (and other
            responsible family cars) so I was fitting in, but it didn&apos;t feel right. Drives smooth and gets the job
            done. Nothing to complain about, nothing to brag about. A Camry is just another car and LE trim level, ugh.
            No accidents though and that is worth mentioning as an anomaly.</p>

          <h5>(#9) 2009 Pontiac Vibe GT (Aug 08 - Feb 10) - Trixie</h5>
          <p>It only took one test drive and I knew I wanted this car. I went right back to the dealership and told them
            to sell me that car. I am not sure what chemistry there is between a person and a car, maybe its the slight
            resemblance to Medea or the smell of fresh leather, but I found a car I could connect with and appreciate.
            She also introduced me to SiriusXm and new genres of music. Fun fact about the Vibe it&apos;s partly a
            Toyota and
            shared the platform with the Matrix. So while I did leave the Toyota family, not really.</p>
          <p>I did have one minor accident if you want to call it that. I was driving some friends home and I was
            heavily medicated because I had the flu or something (might be unrelated). A landscaping rock was laying in
            the road and Trixie ran right over it. The tire went flat in about 2 seconds as I put a huge gash in the
            tire. I called another friend to come pick up these friends while I called OnStar (I had the flu, it was
            cold out and I had free OnStar, no judgement). A tow truck showed up in a few moments and put my spare tire
            on. I can&apos;t remember the exact price of the tire, but it had to be replaced and it was expensive. It
            was the first low-profile tire I had purchased and wasn&apos;t expecting that price.</p>
          <p>I also had to pick up food for a LAN in this car and filled the back with food and that as fun!</p>
          <p>Take a look at the pictures, she had her first photo shoot on her second day.</p>

            overall length, storage and engine. It was a good car while I had it, but I didn&apos;t feel as though it
            fit me as well as the 05 Scion or the Vibe.</p>

          <p>Teri is a 1993 Toyota Tercel. I bought it so that my brother would have something to drive. I usually only
            drove it when it needed to go to the shop, but it was a fun little car to drive. It is also the most
            expensive thing I have ever bought off of Ebay. I never even went to go see it or to meet the previous
            owner, just bought it and arranged to have a shipping company deliver it; which they did, to my Columbia
            City address. I was in Bloomington. It had hit a deer when I bought it and needed repair; I was able to make
            everything work on my own such as replacing the hood, headlight, grill and radiator. And it made for a nice
            surprise to my brother. I traded it in on Trixie because my brother got another car and Teri needed a new
            transmission.</p>

          <h5>(#6) 2005 Scion XB (Feb 05 - July 07)</h5>
          <p>My XB endured a lot for a new car. Even without me trying to modify it (sorry Aurora). Although I did put
            my Panasonic slide out TV in the dash and two 15&quot; subs in the back with Audiobahn amp. Ah yes, before
            college. Well after all of that. I rear ended someone and had an incident with some paint. It also had a
            chip in the windshield from driving so much on
            the Interstate (semi probably kicked a stone at it (I think I remember the semi)). It was my first new car,
            I was very meticulous with it. And then I parked in a
            hail storm (stood under an awning and watched). I couldn&apos;t catch a break with my new car.</p>
          <p>My modifications after beginning college included a 15&quot; touch screen mounted in front of the passenger
            seat, which could be moved to either of the rear seats for video watching. The computer sat nicely under the
            passenger seat and allowed me to play any of my 75 Gigs (then) of music. Of course I did not
            leave the monitor in my car all of the time. That would be asking to get stolen. The last summer I had it, I
            put a 12&quot; sub in the rear floor and a moderate amp with/capacitor. I then bought a new in-dash screen,
            this time with /navigation to replace the stock stereo. Along with the carputer (actual term) it
            complemented the
            inside of the car nicely. The Aurora would have been proud.</p>

          <p>Ok so I am driving home from work one day and in town I am following a white Blazer (1980&apos;s, cardboard
            on
            the windows - duct tape) and there is a nice Dodge truck in front of him. The Dodge decides to hit his
            brakes at what was probably 30-40mph to completely stop. The Blazer in front of me does the same (to avoid
            hitting him). Unfortunately for me, I am too far back to see this going on, but I do hear the tires
            squealing
            and hit my brakes too. I am too late though and plow into the Blazer at about 20mph. The Dodge (having not
            been hit) peels out and is far gone before I can even get out of my car (my door was pinched shut). The guy
            in the Blazer and I call the police and needless to say the whole thing is my fault, so my insurance pays
            for the Blazer guys duct taped bumper and my car to be fixed. This is the damage my car incurred and
            although it just looks like maybe a bumper cover, its not. The total was $5100 and about the entire front
            end was replaced. It took over three weeks to complete because a part or two wasn&apos;t here from Japan
            yet. Pay attention, idiots are everywhere (see next accident)!</p>

          <p>This took place on the evening of January 3, 2006. I was on my way to an oil change at the Toyota
            dealership. Just minding my own business, just like the last incident, when some idiot decides to throw an
            aerosol can of bright orange marking paint out of their window. I am not sure if it was the car in front of
            me or the car in front of them, but I am pretty sure it was the black Chevy Blazer in front of me.
            Regardless, the car in front of me ran over the can and it exploded all over my car and the road. I had to
            turn on the windshield wipers to see. I filed a police report, but no leads. The Blazer got away because the
            police asked me to go back to the site where it happened (I was in pursuit). I did not make a claim to my
            insurance because it would be less than my deductible or close enough. I just used an SOS sponge and windex
            along with the normal weather elements to wear it down. I think people just thought I had a custom paint job
            haha</p>

          <p>I was in Bloomington, where I went to college, and visiting my family who was there at a race (they run). I
            was at a motel and it started to hail. I stood under the awning out in front and watched it ding my car,
            along with many others. One car even had its alarm set off. It wasn&apos;t as bad as I had originally
            thought, but just to be sure, when I traded my car in sometime later I made sure it was after dark. I
            don&apos;t have any pictures because they wouldn&apos;t really show anything.</p>

          <h5>(#5) 1998 GMC Sonoma ( Oct 04 - Feb 05)</h5>
          <p>Next up, a 1998 GMC Sonoma. It was great during the winter, although it still did not handle as well as my
            Aurora (who could live up to the high standards of the Aurora). I took the ABS fuse out of it because I got
            better stopping distance in the winter without it. The
            4WD was only good in the snow or in the woods. The Aurora&apos;s traction control proved better on the slick
            roads.</p>
          <p>I remember driving in the country on a snowy road in winter and when approaching a 90 degree turn the truck
            turned only slightly. Panicking as I headed toward some trees in a person&apos;s yard. I managed to slide
            between them with the ABS stuttering at me (this was the last straw that made me remove the fuse). Luckily I
            was able to just circle around in the yard to the driveway and head on my way. The ground was all frozen and
            no damage was done.</p>
          <p>I also remembering driving back from Fort Wayne after picking up my brother and all of a sudden it swerves
            to the right going off the road slightly. I pull it back to the road it does it again. I pull over to
            inspect. The front passenger wheel is looking more than a little tilted. I drove it to our mechanic in town
            (I was 2 miles away). Turns out the only thing holding the wheel on was the center bolt. I got lucky and
            didn&apos;t damage the rim, but that was an odd experience.</p>
          <p>I was also rear ended in the truck by someone from school driving home from school. No damage to the
            truck, but nearly totalled his car.</p>
          <p>The Sonoma was not economical either and with college coming in a year that was on
            my mind and part of the reason for trading it in on the 05 Scion. These pictures are not of my actual truck,
            only color and model.</p>

          <p>This was a fun car. It was a convenient purchase at the time and I enjoyed
            driving it. Very dependable, but not economical (14mpg highway). I drove it to Bloomington, IN from Columbia
            City, IN (3 hour drive) and around Indianapolis for a few hours and with a hearty 173,000 miles on it;
            awesome car. The car gave you a certain aura and made you drive slow and you wanted to for some reason. It
            was also the first non fuel injected car I drove. I only owned it for about two months then sold it for
            ~$1700 profit. These pictures are also not of my actual car, only color and model.</p>

          <h5>(#3) 1991 Mazda 626 ( Aug 04 - Aug 05 )</h5>
          <p>I bought this car hoping it would last me through the winter as a project that I could drive after the
            Aurora. It ended up getting scrapped the next summer and was
            never a vehicle I could rely on daily. Before I bought it, it hit two deer (different incidents) and ran
            over/hit a third deer.
            The car was in a lawsuit for faulty repairs (before I owned it) and before the deer and lawsuit it already
            had a salvage title. Can you see the appeal? Well 17 year old me did. I drove it over 2 hours home without a
            drop of coolant in the radiator. It could then
            only be pull/push started and ran another hour without coolant. Mind you this isn&apos;t smooth driving-
            this is a car that has clearly been abused and was being driven by a novice manual driver :) Don&apos;t
            ask me why I assumed the previous owner had topped it off with coolant, but he hadn&apos;t and I regret not
            checking. One word sums up this car BEAST. These pictures are not of my actual car, only model and color. I
            basically just used it to drive around the field for fun and to teach a friend how to drive a manual. It was
            only $300 and scrapped for $100 so worth the fun and memories.</p>

          <h5>(#2) 1995 Oldsmobile Aurora (~Feb 03 - Oct 04)</h5>
          <p>This is my favorite car to date. A 1995 Oldsmobile Aurora. I had this car for most of my high school career
            and I love it to this day. Maybe someday I will find a car that I can love more than this one, but until
            then here we go. I think there is a bond between a high school senior and the car they had that cannot be
            broken.</p>
          <p>The biggest reason that I loved this car so much was its durability and driving style. I used it for paper
            routes almost every weekend during winters and I cannot explain the stress it took here, it held up very
            well. It was expensive to fix when it needed it and therefore chose to delay many repairs -- then sold
            it.</p>
          <p>Some up front facts about the Aurora before the lengthy short story. The Aurora was about $35,000 brand new
            and $16,000 when we bought it in ~1998. The battery is located under the rear seat instead of under the
            hood. It has a 4.0 liter Northstar engine (like the Cadillacs of the day, but smaller). It also has every
            bell and whistle
            of the cars at the time - heated seats, memory seats and mirrors, traction control, power trans feature
            (over-drive off in other words) and about an electrical engineers&apos; worst nightmare stock from the
            factory.</p>
          <p>A short list of the modifications include: upgraded stereo to my Panasonic in-dash TV unit, subs (various
            styles/types), wing to the trunk (wing=giant spoiler which I still have!!), removed center console to make
            room for PS2 - then
            decided I still needed cup holders, so I removed the PS2 and made some cup holders out of PVC and wood.
            Don&apos;t worry I painted them black. I then needed switches for
            everything including the reverse lights. The garage door button compartment looked
            like a good place to start. I removed the button and drilled holes. Long story short - I had a new red
            dome light and two switches. I also added two more switches to the stereo panel faceplate. I also got this
            idea that I could put the PS2 and a VCR into this built in cabinet in the back along with my amp. I removed
            the rear seat (all of it (including the back part)). The design is a little complicated to put into words,
            so long story short I had the three things mentioned installed along with some red LED fans, some plexiglas
            so you could see into the trunk (to see the subs) along with some blue accent lights. I covered all of the
            wood with black carpet. Looked great actually, but only lasted for about two weeks. I had no rear seats or
            trunk space and you may see the complications this brought. Oh yeah, and I had a car alarm installed. Did I
            mention I drilled a hole into the gas tank in the process of Operation Remove Rear Seats. I can safely say I
            added over 200 feet in additional wiring to the car&apos;s schematics. I knew what wire went to which fuses
            and could also draw a diagram of exactly how I bi-passed (or re-wired) the stock options to my newly crafted
            switches. It is safe to say I had no problem drilling holes in anything on or in the car, hence the wing,
            gas tank, removing major interior components. If there is one thing I regret more than selling it, would be
            not taking pictures. My friends could tell you more, as this is a short list. These are not
            my actual car pictures, only color and model.</p>
          <p>Accidents were minimal in the Aurora. The first story was going to the movies with my friend Jared, my
            brother and his friend. It had recently rained and for no real reason I was swerving pot holes on a country
            road. Well in a blink I was suddenly backwards in a ditch. No damage, some mud on the car, but I don&apos;t
            remember spinning at all, but everyone else in the car does haha. Tires on the passenger side ended up going
            flat that week with lots of mud in the rim. Second thing was dumb, I was challenging my friends that the
            barrels along the road were hollow because I had seen them spin and collapse one before. Turns out some of
            them have water/sand in them. I put a nice orange dent in the front fender from that experiment. I
            wasn&apos;t going fast, but didn&apos;t need to be as I don&apos;t think the barrel moved at all.</p>
          <p>Last story, off-road racing. My parents bought an acre and half down the road from us that was part of a
            cornfield, but was auctioned off to be plots for houses. We had it smoothed out and had been mowing it to
            put on the market. Well the distance was just about right to race from the road to the back. If a car
            didn&apos;t stop it would just slide into the corn field and that&apos;d stop them right! The line-up: Seth
            - Aurora, Blake - Sundance, Aaron G - Taurus SHO, Jared - Sunfire GT, Aaron J - Lumina, Dan - Town and
            Country. The Sundance due to it&apos;s severe lack of power had zero tire spin in the grass and took off
            like a lightning bolt compared to the rest of us. The Aurora with the superior traction control and weight
            held it&apos;s own as well. I think the Lumina was still spinning tires at the start after we had all
            finished, but to be fair we had been telling him to get new tires for months. I cannot recall the winner
            (not me) but it wasn&apos;t really the point of the race. It was fun and despite Blake stopping well clear
            of the corn field decided to continue to drive into it. Sorry farmer for the Sundance-sized loss in crop
            that year.</p>

          <h5>(#1) 1991 Chevrolet S-10 (Aug 02 - ~Feb 03)</h5>
          <p>This was my first vehicle and was my parent&apos; 3rd vehicle. I didn&apos;t like this
            truck when I had it because it had no options, but looking back at it, a great first vehicle. I also learned
            that if you stop really fast with unsecured cargo in the bed you will bend the bed up against the cab. Ahh,
            that&apos;s what bungee cords are for; should have bought some. I also learned how to change a water pump
            and alternator myself, so it was a learning experience.</p>
          <p>I was in a rare accident involving a windmill (see pictures). This was a great first vehicle because it
            didn&apos;t matter if you damaged it, unfortunately it was not the same case for the windmill which was my
            grand-father&apos;s.</p>

          <h5>Honorable Mention - 4th Garage Space Award: 2019 Kubota BX2380</h5>
          <p>I bought my dad&apos;s Kubota (BX2370) after my parents moved from the farm to in-town. I then decided to
            upgrade it to the newer model about a year afterwards. It has been far superior to anything I&apos;ve mowed
            with to date. It came with the mower deck and bucket. I have the 4 foot tiller from the first one as well as
            a plow, post hole digger and yard vac. The yard vac is my favorite so far and picking up leaves
            has never been so fun. Of course digging holes is fun too and I have 3 implements for that haha.</p>

          <h5>Honorable Mention - Most desired Award: Aston Martin</h5>
          <p>The car of my dreams for some day when I can afford it, whatever the current model year is called: some
            descendent of the Vanquish. They are custom built in England and sell for about $450,000. I would like one
            of these sometime in my life. Do you think it resembles an Aurora? Just a little?</p>

          <h5>Honorable Mention - First and Worst Rental Award: 2005 Chevrolet Cavalier (Jun 05)</h5>
          <p>This was my first rental car (a 2005 Chevy Cavalier) while my 05 Xb was in the shop. It was not a good car
            and I would never recommend this car to anyone. It is a toy, not a real car and I treated it accordingly. It
            does not deserve two pictures, but since I had to drive it for awhile (32 days 6 hours) I am warning the
            general public: &quot;Toy not recommended for daily driving, people having concern for safety or who for
            people who don&apos;t like wasting money.&quot; I was doing a routine brake check in it (brake pedal
            completely to the floor from about 50mph) and it died; just shut off. I killed an
            automatic by stopping too hard; which I did not even know you could do. I also made sure to test the
            handbrake, about every time I needed to turn and park. We would randomly open the doors while driving and
            slam them shut as hard as humanly possible. We would also just randomly punch the inside components, the toy
            was seemingly durable, but then again, so are toddler toys. Maybe it was all of the built up teenage rage,
            who knows, I beat the crap out of this thing. I also see why they don&apos;t like giving rental cars to
            teenagers and to think some poor person probably bought this thing later...</p>

          <h5>Honorable Mention - Most pieces Award: 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier (Aug 13)</h5>
          <p>This was a scrap car (engine seized) on the property where I co-rented a duplex. I think it may have been
            repressed memories from that rental car, but this was very cathartic.</p>
